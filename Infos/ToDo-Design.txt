1. App Name

Since it’s a product browsing app with login, pagination, and editing, you want something neutral but modern.

👉 Suggested name: “Shoply”
(short, professional, fits e-commerce/product listing theme).

2. UI Design Plan
Navigation Flow

AuthStack

Login Screen → user enters username/password

AppTabs (after login)

Home Tab → product list with infinite scroll

Favorites Tab (placeholder) → future products saved by user

Profile Tab (placeholder) → future user settings

Product Screen → pushed on stack when a product is clicked

4. Extra UI/UX Criteria

✅ Feedback: loader, error, empty states.
✅ Animations: smooth modal, maybe slight card hover/press animation.
✅ Dark Mode (bonus): optional if you want to impress.
